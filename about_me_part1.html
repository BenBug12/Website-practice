        <h2>*About me:</h2>
            <p>My name is Benjamin Marin Jr, and I've been going to UTRGV for close to 7 years.  I've got around 6 or 7 courses left and im planning on taking these courses slow but steady since I have to work as well to pay for my classes.  I like to play any RPG games and anything related to strategy like YU-GI-OH just for fun.  I also enjoy learning about computers and how they work and really enjoy when a program starts working especially when that program does not run and for at least trying to figure out why it doesn't work only to find out after nearly half an hour finding out that the issue was only a syntax error.</p> <div>
        <h2>Project and where would I like to go</h2>
            <p>My favorite project I worked once was a cash counting calculator that saves time adding up all of the cash values and just adds the money up together and im planning on seeing if I could implement one on a website.  One day I would like to find a job nearby here in the valley or maybe work remotely since I would like to stay near since I would like to help take care of my parents.  I like this class I find it interesting that there are different job roles within a company or a team creating software and can use my specialty and working as a team to get the software to deploy.</p>
        
        <p>My favorite card 
            <div>Ancient Gear Golem</div> 
            <div>I remember openning a pack and got 2 copies of the card.</div></p>
